# Cellular Automata
This project was created for the module "Orientierung und Methoden" at the Hochschule Osnabr√ºck
A modular and extensible **Cellular Automata** simulator that lets you explore complex systems from simple rules. This project comes with some predefined custom rule sets and lets you practrice writing custom compute shaders.

##  Features

- Adjustable simulation speed, grid size, and initial conditions
- Optional animation or step-by-step playback
- Double Buffering
- Optimized with Multithreading / Parallel Processing
- Compute shaders and GPU Acceleration
